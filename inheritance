The idea behind inheritance in Java is that you can create new classes that are built upon existing classes. When you inherit from an existing class, you can reuse methods and fields of the parent class. Moreover, you can add new methods and fields in your current class also.
Inheritance represents the IS-A relationship which is also known as a parent-child relationship.

The syntax of Java Inheritance
class Subclass-name extends Superclass-name  
{  
   //methods and fields  
}
