If a class have an entity reference, it is known as Aggregation. Aggregation represents HAS-A relationship.
Consider a situation, Employee object contains many informations such as id, name, emailId etc. It contains one more object named address, which contains its own informations such as city, state, country, zipcode etc. as given below.

Understanding meaningful example of Aggregation
In this example, Employee has an object of Address, address object contains its own informations such as city, state, country etc. In such case relationship is Employee HAS-A address.

Address.java
public class Address {  
String city,state,country;  
  
public Address(String city, String state, String country) {  
    this.city = city;  
    this.state = state;  
    this.country = country;  
}  
  
}  
Emp.java
public class Emp {  
int id;  
String name;  
Address address;  
  
public Emp(int id, String name,Address address) {  
    this.id = id;  
    this.name = name;  
    this.address=address;  
}  
  
void display(){  
System.out.println(id+" "+name);  
System.out.println(address.city+" "+address.state+" "+address.country);  
}  
  
public static void main(String[] args) {  
Address address1=new Address("gzb","UP","india");  
Address address2=new Address("gno","UP","india");  
  
Emp e=new Emp(111,"varun",address1);  
Emp e2=new Emp(112,"arun",address2);  
      
e.display();  
e2.display();
