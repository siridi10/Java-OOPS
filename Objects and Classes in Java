An object in Java is the physical as well as a logical entity, whereas, a class in Java is a logical entity only.

What is an object in Java?
An entity that has state and behavior is known as an object.
e.g:-chair,bike,marker,pen,etc.
It can be physical or logical (tangible and intangible).
The example of an intangible object is the banking system.

Object have 3 characteristics:-
State --> Represents the data of an object.
Behavior --> Represents the functionality of an object such as deposit, withdraw, etc.
Identity --> An object identity is typically implemented via a unique ID.

For Example, Pen is an object. Its name is Reynolds; color is white, known as its state. It is used to write, so writing is its behavior.

An object is an instance of a class. A class is a template or blueprint from which objects are created. So, an object is the instance(result) of a class.
