An object in Java is the physical as well as a logical entity, whereas, a class in Java is a logical entity only.

What is an object in Java?
An entity that has state and behavior is known as an object.
e.g:-chair,bike,marker,pen,etc.
It can be physical or logical (tangible and intangible).
The example of an intangible object is the banking system.

Object have 3 characteristics:-
State --> Represents the data of an object.
Behavior --> Represents the functionality of an object such as deposit, withdraw, etc.
Identity --> An object identity is typically implemented via a unique ID.

For Example, Pen is an object. Its name is Reynolds; color is white, known as its state. It is used to write, so writing is its behavior.

An object is an instance of a class. A class is a template or blueprint from which objects are created. So, an object is the instance(result) of a class.

Object Definitions:
-------------------
An object is a real-world entity,runtime entity,entity which has state and behavior,instance of a class.

What is a class in Java
-----------------------
A class is a group of objects which have common properties.
It is a template or blueprint from which objects are created. 
It is a logical entity.
It can't be physical.

A class in Java can contain:Fields,Methods,Constructors,Blocks,Nested class and interface.

Syntax to declare a class:
-------------------------
class <class_name>{  
    field;  
    method;  
}  

Method in Java
--------------
In Java, a method is like a function which is used to expose the behavior of an object.

Advantage of Method:-
--------------------
Code Reusability
Code Optimization

Object and Class Example: main within the class
-----------------------------------------------
class Student{  
 //defining fields  
 int id;//field or data member or instance variable  
 String name;  
 //creating main method inside the Student class  
 public static void main(String args[]){  
  //Creating an object or instance  
  Student s1=new Student();//creating an object of Student  
  //Printing values of the object  
  System.out.println(s1.id);//accessing member through reference variable  
  System.out.println(s1.name);  
 }  
}  
Output:
0 
null

Object and Class Example: main outside the class
------------------------------------------------
class Student{  
 int id;  
 String name;  
}  
//Creating another class TestStudent1 which contains the main method  
class TestStudent1{  
 public static void main(String args[]){  
  Student s1=new Student();  
  System.out.println(s1.id);  
  System.out.println(s1.name);  
 }  
}  

Output
0 
null
