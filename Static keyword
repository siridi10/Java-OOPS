Java static keyword
-------------------
The static keyword is used for memory management.
We can use static keyword with variables, methods, blocks and nested classes.

The static can be:
Variable (also known as a class variable)
Method (also known as a class method)
Block
Nested class

1) Java static variable:-
-------------------------
The static variable can be used to refer to the common property of all objects.
for example, the company name of employees, college name of students, etc.
The static variable gets memory only once in the class area at the time of class loading.

Advantages of static variable
It makes your program memory efficient (i.e., it saves memory).
class Student{  
     int rollno;  
     String name;  
     String college="ITS";  
}  

Example of counter by static variable
------------------------------------  
class Counter2{  
static int count=0;//will get memory only once and retain its value  
  
Counter2(){  
count++;//incrementing the value of static variable  
System.out.println(count);  
}  
  
public static void main(String args[]){  
Counter2 c1=new Counter2();  
Counter2 c2=new Counter2();  
Counter2 c3=new Counter2();  
}  
}  

Output:
1
2
3
