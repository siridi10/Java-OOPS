Java static keyword
-------------------
The static keyword is used for memory management.
We can use static keyword with variables, methods, blocks and nested classes.

The static can be:
Variable (also known as a class variable)
Method (also known as a class method)
Block
Nested class

1) Java static variable:-
-------------------------
The static variable can be used to refer to the common property of all objects.
for example, the company name of employees, college name of students, etc.
The static variable gets memory only once in the class area at the time of class loading.

Advantages of static variable
It makes your program memory efficient (i.e., it saves memory).
class Student{  
     int rollno;  
     String name;  
     String college="ITS";  
}  

Example of counter by static variable
------------------------------------  
class Counter2{  
static int count=0;//will get memory only once and retain its value  
  
Counter2(){  
count++;//incrementing the value of static variable  
System.out.println(count);  
}  
  
public static void main(String args[]){  
Counter2 c1=new Counter2();  
Counter2 c2=new Counter2();  
Counter2 c3=new Counter2();  
}  
}  

Output:
1
2
3

2) Java static method
---------------------
If you apply static keyword with any method, it is known as static method.
A static method belongs to the class rather than the object of a class.
A static method can be invoked without the need for creating an instance of a class.
A static method can access static data member and can change the value of it.

Example of static method
----------------------  
class Student{  
     int rollno;  
     String name;  
     static String college = "ITS";  
     //static method to change the value of static variable  
     static void change(){  
     college = "BBDIT";  
     }  
  
     Student(int r, String n){  
     rollno = r;  
     name = n;  
     }  
  
     void display(){System.out.println(rollno+" "+name+" "+college);}  
}  
  
public class TestStaticMethod{  
    public static void main(String args[]){  
    Student.change();//calling change method  
    //creating objects  
    Student s1 = new Student(111,"Karan");  
    Student s2 = new Student(222,"Aryan");  
    Student s3 = new Student(333,"Sonoo");  
    //calling display method  
    s1.display();  
    s2.display();  
    s3.display();  
    }  
}  

Output:111 Karan BBDIT
       222 Aryan BBDIT
       333 Sonoo BBDIT
       
       
3) Java static block
------------------
Is used to initialize the static data member.
It is executed before the main method at the time of classloading.

Example of static block
----------------------
class A2{  
  static{System.out.println("static block is invoked");}  
  public static void main(String args[]){  
   System.out.println("Hello main");  
  }  
}  

Output:static block is invoked
       Hello main
